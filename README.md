## Introduction

This project is dedicated to computer vision and face recognition using the LBPH (Local Binary Pattern Histogram) algorithm. LBPH is a robust face recognition technique known for its effectiveness in handling variations in lighting conditions, facial expressions, and more.

## Project Overview

In this project, we implement a face recognition system using the LBPHFaceRecognizer_create module, a part of the OpenCV library. LBPH is used for feature extraction and recognition, making it a suitable choice for a wide range of applications, including security systems and access control.

## Features

- **LBPH Recognition:** Utilizes the LBPHFaceRecognizer_create module for accurate and robust face recognition.

- **Customizable:** The system is designed to be flexible and adaptable for various use cases.

- **Real-time Recognition:** Provides real-time facial recognition capabilities for applications requiring quick and accurate identification.

- **Scalability:** The project is designed with scalability in mind, allowing for integration with other computer vision and machine learning techniques.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following requirements in place:

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- Additional Python libraries as specified in the project's requirements file

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ASS_ComputerVision.git
   ```

2. Run the file collect data to collect your face:

   ```bash
   python run datacollect.py
   ```
3. Train the model:
  ```bash
   python run trainingdemo.py
   ```
4. Run in real-time:
   ```bash
   python run testmodel.py
   ```
## Usage

1. Follow the instructions provided in the project's documentation to set up and customize the face recognition system for your specific needs.

2. Train the system with the target faces by providing labeled data.

3. Implement the LBPHFaceRecognizer_create module for real-time face recognition.
